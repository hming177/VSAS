# VSAS for L0-LPRE
L0 regularized for high-dimensional sparse multiplicative models with the variable sorted active set algorithm

Paper: Ming H., Yang H., Xia X. (2023+). L0 regularized for high-dimensional sparse multiplicative models with the variable sorted active set algorithm. Submit to journal.

The R code implementing L0-LPRE is in the compressed package "L0-LPRE.rar", where the "Demo_Functions.R" contains all the comparison methods in the article, such as LASSA-LS, MCP-LS, SCAD-LS, L0-LS. The reader can reproduce Example 6 by running "Demo_Functions.R" and then "Demo_Example_Six.R".
